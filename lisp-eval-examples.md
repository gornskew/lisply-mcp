# Lisp Evaluation Examples with Gendl

The Gendl MCP wrapper provides a `lisp_eval` tool that allows you to evaluate Lisp code directly within the Gendl environment. This document provides examples of how to use this feature.

## Basic Lisp Evaluation

You can evaluate simple Lisp expressions:

```lisp
(+ 1 2 3)
```

Result: `6`

## Working with GDL Objects

GDL (Generative Declarative Language) is the core declarative modeling language in Gendl. Here are examples of defining and using GDL objects:

### Defining a Simple Circle

```lisp
(gendl:define-object circle (base-object)
  :input-slots (radius)
  :computed-slots
  ((area (* pi (expt (the radius) 2)))
   (circumference (* 2 pi (the radius)))))
```

Result: `#<GDL-CLASS CIRCLE>`

### Creating and Using a Circle Instance

```lisp
(let ((my-circle (make-self 'circle :radius 5)))
  (list :area (the-object my-circle area)
        :circumference (the-object my-circle circumference)))
```

Result: `(:AREA 78.53981633974483 :CIRCUMFERENCE 31.41592653589793)`

### Defining a Box with Volume and Surface Area

```lisp
(gendl:define-object box (base-object)
  :input-slots
  (length width height)
  :computed-slots
  ((volume (* (the length) (the width) (the height)))
   (surface-area (* 2 (+ (* (the length) (the width))
                         (* (the length) (the height))
                         (* (the width) (the height)))))))
```

Result: `#<GDL-CLASS BOX>`

### Computing Box Properties

```lisp
(let ((box (make-self 'box :length 5 :width 3 :height 2)))
  (list :volume (the-object box volume)
        :surface-area (the-object box surface-area)))
```

Result: `(:VOLUME 30 :SURFACE-AREA 62)`

## Using Gendl via Claude

When interacting with Claude, you can ask it to evaluate Lisp code in Gendl using the `lisp_eval` tool. For example:

```
User: Could you calculate the volume of a box with dimensions 10x5x3?

Claude: I'll calculate the volume of a box with those dimensions using Gendl:

[Claude calls lisp_eval with appropriate code]

The volume of a box with dimensions 10x5x3 is 150 cubic units.
```

## Common Usage Patterns

1. **Define a GDL Object**: First define your GDL object with its properties
2. **Create an Instance**: Use `make-self` to create an instance with specific parameters
3. **Access Properties**: Use `the-object` to access computed properties

## Tips and Best Practices

- Use `define-object` to create reusable object templates
- Separate input slots (parameters) from computed slots (derived values)
- When evaluating expressions, wrap them in `let` bindings to create a clean scope
- Use `make-self` for creating instances in the evaluation context
- Access properties with `the-object` rather than `the` when in a separate context
